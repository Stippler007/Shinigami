Welcome to the world of Zarkrom, a world full of magic and mysteries!
Not everything in this world works the same as in yours.
For example we move pressing the buttons W, A, S and D on the keboard instead of
moving our legs.
Tired of walking, want to travel faster?, you could sprint but this would be a 
lot of work and for longer distances you are soon going to be out of breath. 
Not in Zarkrom. Here you just have to press and hold your right mouse button
and you will sprint without heavy breathing or sweating.
